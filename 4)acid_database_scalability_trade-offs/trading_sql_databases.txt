# Advantages and Disadvantages of Traditional SQL

# ALTER:TABLE: update schema (may not preserve and loose data)
# The need to fit and index all keys limits ability to grow database (RAM)

# ACID:
# Atomicity- transaction functions as a 'unit', suceeds or fails
# Consistency- transaction can only change from valid states
# Isolation- concurrent transactions are isolated not ran sequentially
# Durability- finished transactions survive runtime system failure

# Set of guarantees provide by use of transaction,
#  ensuring data is always in valid state; even through failure
