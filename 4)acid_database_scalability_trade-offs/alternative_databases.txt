# Map Reduce: provides the framework aloows specification of a job,
# that is then distributed by larger worker nodes
# (Horizontal Scalibility)
# (Splits data randomly)

# Map: each work gets a piece of input data,
# applies the given 'map' function to process data

# Shuffle: workers redistribute data based on key of,
# output function
# (Collect common data in single worker nodes)

# Reduce: workers concurrently process output data,
# final output combined in master node
