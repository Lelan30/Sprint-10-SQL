# SQL is a standard, and computational implementation of relational algebra
# Relational Algebra: datum are considered members of sets,
# data with the same overall structure(attributes) are members
# of the same data sets.
# Columns shared with keys can relate across all datasets

#  \Pi_{name,id}(\sigma_{state=CA}(Customers)):
# Translates as: "Get the names and ids of all customers from Cali"
# The pi symbol indicates choosing attributes(projection)
# The sigma indicates selection(setting conditions)

# SELECT is the equivilent to the projection of (pi), and WHERE is
# the equivilent of selection (in relational databases)

# SQL = DECLARATIVE
