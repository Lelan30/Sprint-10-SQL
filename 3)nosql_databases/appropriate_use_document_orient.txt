# Document Oriented Databases (NOSQL) ("Schema-Free")
# (Common subset of key:value stores)

# Document-Oriented databases aka: document stores
# (great for storing large amounts of data; generally unstructured)
# Non-Relational approach

# Hash maps, Python dictionaries, JSON

# flexibly store data without specifying structure

# Consider the following: (Relational or Non-Relational)

# 1) A bank, with mission-critical data demanding high reliability and integrity;
# (RELATIONAL: Well defined, Upfront schema is fine, Reliability of SQL)

# 2) A 2-person startup, rapidly developing a prototype in a week to demonstrate to investors
# (EITHER WAY: Document-Orient Skewed, No Schema needed, Likely to rewrite everything)

# 3) A medium size company, profitable and established in their niche, building a new product offering
# (EITHER WAY: Document-Orient Skewed, PostGreSQL scaled up fine, plenty of time to plan)

# 4) A large company, in the same situation as the prior medium size company
# (RELATIONAL: Large company, Big Data usage, Even large companied could use a schema)
